# lj_matrix

This is an exploration of a representation (or descriptor), based on the Lennard-Jones potential, for use in prediction of atomization energies (and possibly other properties) of molecules with Machine Learning (ML).

An implementation of existing representations, this new representation and most of the ML routine is created from the, mostly, ground up.

The data used is from the [QML tutorial repository.](https://github.com/qmlcode/tutorial)
