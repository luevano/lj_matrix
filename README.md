# ml_exp

This is an exploration of ML models for use in prediction of atomization energies (and possibly other properties) of molecules using Machine Learning (ML).

An implementation of most of the ML routine is created from the, mostly, ground up.

* Mostly, the main program is in **ml_exp**, and a new exploration on **other_exp**.

## Data used

* The *QM7* dataset obtained from the [QML tutorial repository](https://github.com/qmlcode/tutorial). This can also be retrieved from the [quantum-machine webpage](http://www.quantum-machine.org/datasets/), but for its use with python, the dataset given by QML is more useful.
* The *QM9* dataset is obtained from the [quantum-machine webpage](http://www.quantum-machine.org/datasets/), but it's slightly modified for its use with python.
* On the other hand, the *periodic table of elements* data was retrieved from [this handy Gist](https://gist.github.com/GoodmanSciences/c2dd862cd38f21b0ad36b8f96b4bf1ee).

*NOTE*: This is not supposed to be a python package (for now), but rather, the basis for future (personal) work.
